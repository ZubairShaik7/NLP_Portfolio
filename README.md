## Program 1

This program is just to practice adding files to this repository.

You can see the [code here](program1.py) and a [descriptive document here](Sample_Document.pdf)

You can see my overview of NLP so far  through this [descriptive document here](Overview_NLP.pdf)

## Assignment 1 - Text Processing

This program is meant to get comfortable with python coding practices including using file I/O, 
regex, pickling, and working with classes.

The program reads in a csv file containing employee information (one per line) and parses the info
line by line to make sure all the info is formatted correctly. It returns a dictionary containing all the 
correctly formatted employee information.

You can see the [code here](NLP_Homework1/zas180004_hw1.py)

To run the program, use the following command within the same directory as the file:
python3 zas180004_hw1.py (insert path to csv file)

Python is useful for text processing because of its simple syntax and many widely
available packages to make processing even easier. This assignment was a good review
of basic python commands and syntax for me and I got to learn more about pickling as well.
This serves as a good base project to be prepared for the upcoming assignments.
