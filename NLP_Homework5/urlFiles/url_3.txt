 2882666 Media Release FÃ©dÃ©ration Internationale de Football Association FIFA-Strasse 20 - P.O. Box - 8044 Zurich - Switzerland Tel: +41-(0)43-222 7777 - Fax: +41-(0)43.222 7878 googleoff: index Football Governance  googleon: index FIFA Appeal Committee passes decision on Lionel Messi googleoff: index (FIFA.com)  05 May 2017 googleon: index       Â© Getty Images        The FIFA Appeal Committee has upheld the appeal lodged by the Argentinian Football Association, on behalf of the player Lionel Messi, against the  decision  taken by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee, lifting the sanctions imposed on him as a result.  
 
Following a hearing which took place in Zurich on 4 May 2017, the Appeal Committee has set aside the decision taken by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee on 28 March 2017, which, in application of art. 77 a) of the  FIFA Disciplinary Code  (FDC), had found Lionel Messi guilty of infringing art. 57 of the FDC for having directed insulting words at an assistant referee.  
 
Despite the fact that the FIFA Appeal Committee considered Lionel Messi’s behaviour as reproachable, the former concluded that the evidence available was not sufficient to establish to the appropriate standard, i.e. to the comfortable satisfaction of the members of the Appeal Committee, that art. 77 a) of the FDC, according to which the Disciplinary Committee is responsible for sanctioning serious infringements which have escaped the match officials’ attention, could be applied. 
 
The Appeal Committee nevertheless underlines the importance of always showing respect to the match officials, stressing that such a principle is essential in football and any unsporting conduct that may be contrary to the principles of fair play cannot be accepted. 
 
In view of the above decision, the suspension for four matches imposed on Lionel Messi, which entered into force on 28 March 2017, and the fine of CHF 10,000 have been lifted.
